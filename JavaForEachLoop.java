    For-Each Loop

There is also a "for-each" loop, which is used exclusively to loop through elements in an array:
        syntax

        for (type variableName : arrayName) {
          // code block to be executed
        }

        e.g
                    public class Main {
              public static void main(String[] args) {
                String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
                for (String i : cars) {
                  System.out.println(i);
                }
              }
            }  output   Volvo
                        BMW
                        Ford
                        Mazda
